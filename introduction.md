# Welcome to the World of PyScript: Python in the Browser

PyScript is the new revolutionary platform for Python in the browser.

Thanks to custom tags and extensions, PyScript enables users to embed
standard Python code into a web page, that runs directly into the browser
with _no installation_ required.

In this module, we will explore the main features of the PyScript platform.
We will learn how PyScript works, and how to use it to create rich web
app in the browser with Python.

We will work on multiple exercises as an opportunity to dive into specific PyScript
features and functionalities, and to immediately put in practice what we learn.

We will use the **latest** (_at the time of writing_, ed.) version of
PyScript (i.e. release `2023.09.01`), which brings lots of innovations
compared to previous releases.

We will try to capture and highlight all these features as we work on the exercises.
