# Welcome to the World of PyScript: Python in the Browser

PyScript is the new revolutionary platform for Python in the browser.

Thanks to custom tags and extensions, PyScript enables users to embed
standard Python code into a web page, that runs directly into the browser
with _no installation_ required.

In this module, we will explore the main features of the PyScript platform.
We will learn how PyScript works, and how to use it to create rich web
app in the browser with Python.

We will work on multiple exercises as an opportunity to dive into specific PyScript
features and functionalities, and to immediately put in practice what we learn.

We will use the **latest** (_at the time of writing_, ed.) version of
PyScript (i.e. release `2023.09.01`), which brings lots of innovations
(and also some _backward incompatibilities_) compared to previous releases.
In fact, the `2023.09.01` release marks the beginning of a completely new
and re-engineered version of the platform, so that all the other releases
are now officially referred to as the 
["classic"](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/tree/classic) PyScript.

We will capture and highlight the differences and novelties between the new and the 
classic ones that we find as we work on the exercises, so that even users 
with previous experience with PyScript can benefit from this course.

This module is part of the "PyScript Course" syllabus, composed of several modules each
tailored to expand on specific aspects and use cases of PyScript.

The current module is aimed at beginners, as well as more experienced users, who are willing
to learn more about PyScript, and its underlying technologies that enables Python to run
