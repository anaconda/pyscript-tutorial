# Welcome to the World of PyScript: Python in the Browser

PyScript is the new revolutionary platform for Python in the browser.

Thanks to special tags and extensions, PyScript enables users to embed
standard Python code into a web page, that runs directly into the browser
with _no installation_ required.

In this module, we will explore the main features of the PyScript platform.
We will learn how PyScript works, and how to use it to create rich web
app in the browser with Python.

We will work on multiple exercises as an opportunity to dive into specific PyScript
features and functionalities, and to immediately put in practice what we learn.

We will use the **latest** version of PyScript (i.e. `2023.09.01`), which brings
lots of innovations (and _backward incompatibilities_) compared to
previous releases. Therefore, you can similarly benefit from this course whether you are
completely new to PyScript, or you already have some experience with working with previous
versions of PyScript.
