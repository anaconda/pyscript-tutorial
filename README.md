# Welcome to the World of PyScript: Python in the Browser

PyScript is the new revolutionary platform for Python in the browser.

Thanks to custom tags and extensions, PyScript enables users to embed
standard Python code into a web page, that runs directly into the browser
with _no installation_ required.

In this module, we will explore the main features of the PyScript platform.
We will learn how PyScript works, and how to use it to create rich web
app in the browser with Python.

We will work on multiple exercises as an opportunity to dive into specific PyScript
features and functionalities, and to immediately put in practice what we learn.

We will use the **latest** (_at the time of writing_, ed.) version of
PyScript (i.e. release `2023.09.01`), which brings lots of innovations
compared to previous releases.

We will try to capture and highlight all these features as we work on the exercises.

## Learning Path

> TEMPORARY - LONG TERM - IGNORE FOR NOW üòÅ

This module is part of the "PyScript Course" syllabus, composed of several modules each
tailored to expand on specific aspects and use cases of PyScript.

The current module is aimed at beginners, as well as more experienced users, who are willing
to learn more about PyScript, and its underlying technologies that enables Python to run
directly in the browser.

# Getting Started with PyScript

In this module, we will learn how to get started with PyScript.
We will learn how it works, how to work with it, and will explore
the many features PyScript provides to create rich web applications.

## How to navigate through the content

In each chapter, we will work on a single PyScript app aimed at exploring specific
features, and capabilities offered by the platform.

You are totally free to choose the pace you navigate through content, depending on your
background, your coding skills, or any particular interest in the covered topics.

There will be five sections, each sharing the same content organization:
- ‚è≥ Get Ready
- üßë‚Äçüíª Hands on
- ‚öôÔ∏è How it works
- üéÅ Wrap up
- ü•° Take away lessons

> üí° Block-quote paragraph will also be included to highlight specific concepts, or for general remarks.

We will be using different emojis to mark block-quote paragraphs of different nature.

The most common one will be:

> üí° To highlight spotlight comments, generally used for further explanations, or
> insightful considerations.

But you will also find:

> ‚úÖ To mark the end of the coding part, so that we can proceed to run our example,
> and discuss how it works.

> üéÆ To emphasize that we will use, or open the JavaScript console
> (_and_ üéÆ _is what you'd get if you search for "console" emoji_, ed.)

Some chapters also include a special section (marked by the üîç emoji)
dedicated to expand on particular topics introduced earlier in the chapter.
Feel free to skip those sections while you are working on the exercises, and
to come back at them later at any time.

## How to work with the hands-on exercises

To work on the apps we will be using [PyScript.com](https://pyscript.com),
that is a flexible coding environment specifically designed
to immediately work with PyScript.

PyScript.com is completely **free** to use. You only need to sign up
to create your account, and you are ready to go.

Once logged in, you get access to your **Dashboard**, where all your apps reside,
along with a public catalog of _Trending_ and _Featured_ apps.

Last but (_by no means_, ed.) not least, PyScript.com provides out of the box
an easy way to _distribute_ and _share_ your apps, as well as to _clone_ other
existing apps.

PyScript.com is indeed absolutely perfect to get started with PyScript.
We will explore a bit more in details some of its features in chapter 1, and we
will use to work on all the exercises in this module.

As for the web browser, any modern we browser would do!
So please feel free to use the one you are feeling
most comfortable with. I will be using Google Chrome, for the exact same reason.
This means that some references reported
in the text (e.g. to the Web Inspector / JavaScript console) may need to be re-adapted
to your web browser, accordingly.

When you are working on the hands on parts, I would strongly encourage you
to _write_ yourself the code reported in the sections
(_unless sometimes differently instructed_), rather than simply
copying and pasting it.
This would help you a lot in familiarizing with the code, and the new
technology, especially if you are an absolute beginner.
