# Welcome to the World of PyScript: Python in the Browser

PyScript is the new revolutionary platform for Python in the browser.

Thanks to custom tags and extensions, PyScript enables users to embed
standard Python code into a web page, that runs directly into the browser
with _no installation_ required.

In this course, we will explore the main features of the PyScript platform.
We will learn how PyScript works, and how to use it to create rich web
app in the browser with Python.

We will work on multiple exercises as an opportunity to dive into specific PyScript
features and functionalities, and to immediately see in practice what we 
have learned.

We will use the **latest** version of PyScript (i.e. release `2024.1.1`), 
which brings lots of innovations and **new** features compared to any 
previous releases.

We will try to capture and highlight all these features as we work on the exercises.

## Learning Path

> ⚠️ **Temporary**
> This course is part of the "A PyScript Primer Course" syllabus, 
> composed of several modules each tailored to expand on specific aspects 
> and use cases of PyScript.

The current module is designed to be accessible to anyone
(_beginners, as well as more experienced Python users_), who are willing
to learn more about PyScript, and explore in details the underlying 
technologies that enables Python to run directly into the browser.

### Prerequisite

Beginner-level experience with programming in Python is required to work on
the materials of this course. In particular, you should be familiar with
Python basic data structures, and language constructs (e.g. `for loops`, 
`conditionals`, and `function`).

No previous experience with web development is required to work on this course, 
but having some experience with HTML, and the web would
definitely be a plus.

### Motivations

In other words: _Why would you work on this course_ ?

This course offers in-depth learning opportunity
to explore the new world of PyScript, and of Python in the browser.
The course strongly encourages two main principles:
(1) _self-paced_ learning, and (2) _learning by doing_.
In other words, you are totally free to choose the pace when going
through the learning material, taking your time to learn, and absorb
the various topics, based on your background, and how familiar you are
with the technologies at hand.
Also, you will be given a very practical (_hands-on_) perspective on
the various topics that will be covered in this course.
Nonetheless, all the coding parts will be guided, and detailed
explanations will be provided to better understand each concept in details.

At the end of this course you will learn:
- how to develop interactive web apps with PyScript;
- how PyScript works;
- how to use PyScript better, and using its numerous features according 
  to your use case;
