## Reading Excel (`.xls`) files with PyScript

In this Section we will work on a PyScript app to read Excel
files in the browser.
More specifically, this app will be our opportunity to dive into
additional features offered by the PyScript platform.
In fact, in our app we will need to import external Python packages
(e.g. `xlrd` to read Excel files), and local Python modules.
Moreover, we will also explore how to issue HTTP fetch requests
(e.g. to download our Excel workbook data file) and what
the implications of _synchronous_ vs _asynchronous_ I/O calls.
