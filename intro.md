# Welcome to the World of PyScript: Python in the Browser

Announced for the first time at [PyCon US 2022](https://youtu.be/qKfkCY7cmBQ?t=561)
by co-creators [Peter Wang](https://www.anaconda.com/leadership/peter-wang), and
[Fabio Pliger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiopliger),[PyScript](https://pyscript.net)
is the new revolutionary platform that brings Python into the browser.
In fact, PyScript provides special HTML tags where users can embed their Python code,
which runs directly in the browser, with _no installation_ and _no configuration_ required.
And it's not "just" _standard_ Python 3 code: PyScript gives access to an entire
ecosystem of Python packages, including very popular frameworks for numerical and scientific
computing like `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.
Hence PyScript has not only radically changed how rich web applications can be developed, but
it also pushed the boundaries of data science, turning web browsers into ubiquitous
computing virtual machine.

## Course Structure and Learning Objectives

This course is designed for developers, and data science practitioners who are interested
in learning PyScript, and how to use PyScript to develop interactive data applications.

The course is organised into three chapters, each containing multiple exercises
that will focus on specific learning goals built around a particular PyScript features
to highlight.

In [Chapter 1](./chapter_1.md) we will be focusing on getting started with PyScript.
We will familiarise with the environment, and will learn some of the coolest features
PyScript provides.

In [Chapter 2](./chapter_2.md) we will be start working on some data applications,
focusing specifically on Data Visualisation (`data-viz`). To date, there exist a lot of very
interesting solutions for interactive data viz, gathered both from the Python and the
JavaScript ecosystems. We will work on multiple examples to learn how PyScript supports 
these frameworks, and can integrate with JavaScript libraries.

[Chapter 3](./chapter_3.md) will be focused on using PyScript to develop
_interactive_ Machine Learning (`ML`) applications.
The key feature of these applications is to leverage on the built-in interactivity
provided by the browser to implement ML use cases in a new and unprecedented way:
from [_feature selection_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection) to
[_predictive modelling_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_modelling).
In this chapter, we will learn how to create compelling interactive ML apps
with PyScript to run machine and deep learning models, in the browser.

### Before we start

It is worth mentioning that there is no direct dependency between each chapter.
This means that you are absolutely free to choose your learning path through the content,
deciding whether you would prefer working on each chapter in order, or independently
according to which topic interests you the most.

For example:
> if you are already with PyScript, you are very welcome to skip Chapter 1 entirely,
> and work on exercises in Chapter 2 and 3.
Similarly:
> if you would rather be interested more in learning how to create interactive
> ML apps with PyScript, it would be absolutely fine to jump from Chapter 1 to Chapter 3, and then
> maybe work on Chapter 2 for more PyScript on data-viz apps.

Moreover, please be aware that each Chapter has been designed to be self-consistent:
everything that is required to work on the exercises will be either included directly
in the chapter, or referenced as external resource.
Therefore, all the chapters share **the same** assumptions, and the **same** prerequisites to
work on the code and the exercises.

For example:
> if you are a developer with no extensive knowledge of Machine Learning,
> you should have no problem in working with examples in Chapter 3.

No specific prior knowledge would be assumed as necessary to
work on specific content (_Chapter number 3, I am looking at you!!_ ðŸ‘€), and in case
jargon and technical terms cannot be avoided, they will be clarified in order to ease
the accessibility of the content.

To work with the code it will be necessary to have basic
programming experience with Python, and being familiar with _some_ of the most
popular data science libraries and frameworks in Python such as `numpy`, `pandas`,
`scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

It would be ideal to also have experience with JavaScript, and a general understanding
[how the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works).

If you think that that is not the case for you, we would strongly encourage to start
your journey into this course with [Chapter 1](./chapter_1.md), where some additional references
to basic web programming can also be found.

**That is all!!**

All that you need to get started is a
[Web Browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser).
Any modern we browser would do! So please feel free to use the one you are feeling most
comfortable with.
I will be using Google Chrome, for the exact same reason. Therefore some references reported
in the text (e.g. to the Web Inspector / JavaScript console) would need to be re-adapted 
to your web browser, accordingly.

> I hope you will have as much fun with this course as I had while working on the Chapters ðŸŽ‰
