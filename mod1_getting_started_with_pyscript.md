# Getting Started with PyScript

In this module, we will get our bearings with the many features PyScript provides to create
rich web applications using Python in the browser.

In each section, we will work on a single PyScript app aimed at exploring specific
features, and capabilities offered by the platform.

You are totally free to choose the pace you navigate through content, depending on your
background, your coding skills, or any particular interest in the covered topics.

There will be five sections, each sharing the same content organization:
- ⏳ Get Ready
- 🧑‍💻 Hands on
- ⚙️ How it works
- 🎁 Wrap up
- 🥡 Take away lessons

> 💡 Block-quote paragraph will also be included to highlight specific concepts, or for general remarks.

To work on the apps all that you'd need is a code editor with syntax highlighting, and a Web Browser. 
Any modern we browser would do! So please feel free to use the one you are feeling 
most comfortable with.

I will be using Google Chrome, for the exact same reason. Therefore some references reported
in the text (e.g. to the Web Inspector / JavaScript console) would need to be re-adapted
to your web browser, accordingly.

When you are working on the hands on parts, I would strongly encourage you to _write_ yourself
the code reported in the sections (_unless sometimes differently instructed_), rather than simply
copying and pasting it. This would help you a lot in familiarizing with the code, and the new
technology, especially if you are an absolute beginner.
