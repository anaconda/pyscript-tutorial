# Getting Started with PyScript

In this module, we will learn how to get started with PyScript.
We will learn how it works, how to work with it, and will explore
the many features PyScript provides to create rich web applications.

## How to navigate through the content

In each section, we will work on a single PyScript app aimed at exploring specific
features, and capabilities offered by the platform.

You are totally free to choose the pace you navigate through content, depending on your
background, your coding skills, or any particular interest in the covered topics.

There will be five sections, each sharing the same content organization:
- ⏳ Get Ready
- 🧑‍💻 Hands on
- ⚙️ How it works
- 🎁 Wrap up
- 🥡 Take away lessons

> 💡 Block-quote paragraph will also be included to highlight specific concepts, or for general remarks.

We will be using different emojis to mark block-quote paragraphs of different nature.

The most common one will be:

> 💡 To highlight spotlight comments, generally used for further explanations, or
> insightful considerations.

But you will also find:

> ✅ To mark the end of the coding part, so that we can proceed to run our example,
> and discuss how it works.

> 🎮 To emphasize that we will use, or open the JavaScript console
> (_and_ 🎮 _is what you'd get if you search for "console" emoji_, ed.)

and finally:

> 🆕 When we will be highlighting differences or similarities between the current
> version of PyScript, and PyScript "classic".

## How to work with the hands-on exercises

To work on the apps all that you'd need is a code editor with syntax highlighting, 
and a Web Browser. 
Any modern we browser would do! So please feel free to use the one you are feeling 
most comfortable with. I will be using Google Chrome, for the exact same reason. 
This means that some references reported
in the text (e.g. to the Web Inspector / JavaScript console) may need to be re-adapted
to your web browser, accordingly.

When you are working on the hands on parts, I would strongly encourage you 
to _write_ yourself the code reported in the sections 
(_unless sometimes differently instructed_), rather than simply
copying and pasting it. 
This would help you a lot in familiarizing with the code, and the new
technology, especially if you are an absolute beginner.
